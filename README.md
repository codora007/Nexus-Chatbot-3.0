# Nexus-Chatbot-3.0
Introducing the third generation of the Nexus Chatbot, a powerful and intelligent AI I built in Python. This isn't just a simple search tool; itâ€™s a smart assistant that processes information and provides concise, human-like answers. By using the Google Search API and a Custom Search Engine, Nexus 3.0 goes beyond just linking to search results.
How it works?

I've engineered this version to do the heavy lifting for you. When you ask a question, Nexus 3.0 taps into Google's vast index to find the best sources. Then, its core processing unit analyzes the content of the top results and formulates a single, cohesive answer in a 4-8 line paragraph. This new feature eliminates the need to sift through multiple links, giving you a direct, to-the-point summary of the information you need. All of this is securely managed through a Google Cloud space, ensuring fast and reliable performance
